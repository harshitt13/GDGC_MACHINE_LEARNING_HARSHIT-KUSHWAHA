Introduction
As part of the Core Team Members Recruitment 2024-25, I have worked on the following tasks to demonstrate my technical expertise and analytical abilities.

Tasks
Task 1
Description: You are provided with a dataset about foodborne diseases. Analyze the dataset and answer the questions by applying appropriate Machine Learning models or Data Science techniques.

Approach:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
Feature engineering and preprocessing.
Selection and implementation of appropriate ML models or statistical techniques.
Interpretation and visualization of results.
Task 2
Description: You are provided with a Bone Marrow Cell Classification Dataset. Perform performance analysis on the dataset using two CNN models (custom and pre-built) for their classification abilities. Include evaluation metrics such as:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
AUC-ROC
Confusion Matrix
Approach:

Preprocessing and augmentation of the dataset.
Implementation of two CNN models (custom and pre-built).
Evaluate and compare performance using the specified metrics.
Tabulate results for clarity and include visualizations for AUC-ROC and Confusion Matrix.
